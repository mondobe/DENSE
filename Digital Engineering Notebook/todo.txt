Things that need to get done by sometime

Functional:
 - Controls for the ViewNotebook page
   - CTRL-F: search for entries (someone else has probably put this on GitHub)
   - Edit items after they've been created
   - Duplicate items and edit them
   - Delete/hide items
   - See included files, edit their paths, and exclude them from the project folder
   - Reorder items
 - Open notebook files from any path
 - Use a dropdown for choosing notebooks

Internal:
 - Don't use the XElement "Name" property
 - Dynamically refresh pages to reflect changes in items

Visual:
 - Find a better color palette
 - Automatically adjust with light/dark mode
 - Show items in more encapsulated boxes
