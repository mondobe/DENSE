# Digital-Engineering-Notebook

The culmination of an 11-week-long engineering capstone project, made by a group of five scholars, this is DENSE (Digital Engineering Notebook, Standard Edition). It is built as a replacement to the traditional engineering notebook, friend of engineers throughout the field. It includes all of the capabilities of said physical notebooks, such as recording entries, contacts, and references, but it also includes a few more features, as listed below.

# Load notebook from file

When opening the app, you should see "Welcome to DENSE" and a text entry box. Type in the name of your desired notebook and press "Create new notebook" or "Load notebook". You should be directed to a new screen with space for entries, contacts, and references.

# Adding items

When addding an entry, press "Add Entry" to be taken to a new screen. Whenever you make progress on your current project, type what you've done on the bottom text box (Think git commit messages: "Revised the problem statement for clarity" or "Began cutting PVC pipe to one-inch thickness"). Pressing the back button or ESC will finish the entry, which you can now view on the landing page. For adding contacts or references, press the corresponding button; the process is similar for these.
